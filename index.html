        <h1 class="container-header">Previous Projects</h1>
        <p class="container-paragraph">
            Below are some of my previous projects, many of which were developed using Java and/or Python. 
            In these projects, I primarily adhere to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
            This architectural pattern helps in organizing and separating the different components of an application, making it more modular and easier to maintain.
            <br><br>
            Each project reflects my commitment to clean code practices and robust design principles. 
            Through these projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience in various aspects of software development, 
            from designing user interfaces to implementing complex business logic.
            <br><br>
            Feel free to explore these projects to get a better understanding of my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. 
            If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of these projects in more detail, please don’t hesitate to reach out!
